# Wedge-64 Recovered Files

Files in this directory are as first pulled off the ancient 5.25 floppy disk we still had. These are for the `.e6` version of the source, but the final version was `.e8`.

These are here only for reference. See the `edited Basic files` folder for the files which represent the final version of the Wedge, and see the main README file for more details on the process of editing from `.e6` to `.e8`.

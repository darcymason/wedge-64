# Wedge-64 Source Code Files

This directory represents the reconstruction of the source code for the published version of the Wedge from the earlier version we were able to extract from an old floppy.

The `.bas` files are Windows versions of the converted files, edited to match the PAL output for the final version.

See the [main README](../README.md) for details on the recovery and conversion processes.

The `w64.d64` file is a disk image which can be attached on emulators, to load the tokenized (and ascii->petscii corrected) files made using the modified `hatoucan.py` script.

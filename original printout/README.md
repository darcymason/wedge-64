## Notes on the original printout

We still had a paper copy of the Wedge-64 as published (so it indicates) which was printed in 1984.

It had been printed on a dot matrix printer; the continuous print had been separated at the page boundaries and hole-punched.  The scanner often missed a line or two printed across page boundaries, so these were determined by eye (if they could be) and/or filled in based on a disassembly of the released binary file; the missing lines were stored in a markdown file in this directory.

The printout also includes hand-writing comments and possibilities for modifying the Wedge-64.  These could be starting point for future improvements.  For example, making the device number for disk operations configurable (currently it is assumed to be device 8) would be handy on modern emulators, to which multiple .d64 files could be attached.

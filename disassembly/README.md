## Notes on disassembly

The disassembly here was done from the WEDGE-64-$C000.C file on the Best of Torpet disk
linked in the main README file of this repository, using the
[white-flame interactive disassembler](https://www.white-flame.com/wfdis/) for generic 6502.

Labels were typed in based on the final PAL assembler printout.

This disassembly was used in some cases to determine missing lines from the printout.
